# Basketball AR Game

This is an Augmented Reality (AR) basketball game built with [THREE.js](https://threejs.org), [CANNON.js](https://schteppe.github.io/cannon.js/) and [WEBXR](https://immersiveweb.dev/). The game allows you to place a basketball hoop in your environment and throw a basketball into it.

## Features

- AR hit testing: The game uses the hit testing feature of the WebXR API to place the basketball hoop and the basketball in the real world.
